# Cocktail finder app

Cocktail finder app is a single page web app. The user is able to search through CocktailDB's extensive list of cocktails with ease. Utilizing a search bar that filter's through names of cocktails the user can toggle what type of drink they each cocktail is, whether it is alcoholic, and what type of carafe to serve each drink in. To use the search bar start typing in the name of the cocktail the user is looking for and the search bar will filter the cocktails available. As a fun addition the main header disappears when the mouse hovers over it and the search bar turns the same color as the body background when in use.
